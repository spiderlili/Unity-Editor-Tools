  _characterBio: The Goddess of Excellence and Skill in Battle. Sif enjoys battle,
    and occasionally sends forays into the Blood War out of boredom. Her hair is
    made of pure gold, crafted by the dwarves and enchanted to grow in place of her
    real hair, after the trickster god Loki cut off her original hair as a prank.
