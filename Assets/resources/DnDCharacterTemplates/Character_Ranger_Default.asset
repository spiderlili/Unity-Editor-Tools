  _characterBio: The Showshoe Goddess of Mountains is a frost giant with blonde hair.
    She is particularly skilled at tracking, hunting and slaying dragons, undead,
    magical beasts, aberrations, and vermin, and any weapon she wields is supremely
    lethal against such creatures. She has all the abilities of a druid and ranger.
